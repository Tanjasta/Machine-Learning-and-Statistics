    "\n",
    "The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Sir Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.  The dataset is based on a study where measurements were taken from three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. There are four features (attributes) measured for each flower:\n",
    "* Sepal length (in cm)\n",
    "* Sepal width (in cm)\n",
    "* Petal length (in cm)\n",
    "* Petal width (in cm)\n",
    "There are three classes:\n",
    "* Iris setosa\n",
    "* Iris versicolor\n",
    "* Iris virginica\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically 150 instances in the dataset, with 50 instances for each of the three species. The Iris dataset has become a classic example in the field and is frequently used in tutorials and educational materials for introducing concepts of machine learning and data analysis."
