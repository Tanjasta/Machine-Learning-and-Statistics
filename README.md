# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics

#### Introduction

This repository features two Jupyter Notebooks that highlight various aspects of data analysis, visualisation, and machine learning in Python. 

**Notebooks**

**tasks.ipynb:** A collection of tasks demonstrating various data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python.

**project.ipynb:** * An analysis of the Iris dataset, including a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

* Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

#### Installing Dependencies

Install the following Python libraries to work with the notebooks:

* NumPy for numerical computations.

* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

* Scikit-learn  for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

To install these libraries, run the following command:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

#### Usage

To use these notebooks:

* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

* Navigate to the repository directory.

* Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and open either tasks.ipynb or project.ipynb.
